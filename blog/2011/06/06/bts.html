                <p><strong>(Webdev)</strong> -- Well, if you like it or not it’s school again for most of us this June.</p>
                <p>“Goodbye Summer! Hello School! : |” as many people would say. </p>
				<p>It has been the habit of students to have this kind of feeling at the start of school. Many students would complain that summer was too short or they don’t have the energy to go to school anymore; but for some us it’s the other way around. Some students would be so optimistic about school. They would be so much excited because they want to see their classmates, their new teachers, or even just to see their new classroom.</p>
                <p>All of us have these feelings, sometimes we want to go to school but sometimes we don’t, but at the end of the day we are still obliged to go to school. We are obliged simply because education is important. It is a key to success. <p>
                <p>“Ang kabataan ang pag-asa ng bayan, lalung-lalo na kung may pinag-aralan.”</p>
