                <div id="entry_pic"><img src="002.jpg" border = "none" width="570"/></div>
                <p>It was my first concert ever and it was again, epic I was like a drunk guy dancing and moshpitting... by myself hehehe and screaming like a girl and my mom and sister, who were with me, were like "shocked" on me being a fan of him and I'm just like uhhuhmmm... but inside im like HELL YEAH !!!!!</p>
                <div id="entry_pic"><img src="003.jpg" border = "none" width="570"/></div>
                <p>This was when he did an encore since everybody was like "WE WANT MORE" on him hahaha so he did Runaway Baby (I think) and he also did his dancing on and I can say that his dance moves are awesome as well as his voice. It was a wild night, well for me and several other 100 girls there not including my mom and sister.</p>
