                <p><strong>(Webdev)</strong> -- To be completely honest, one doesn’t see too many good TV shows these days. I’m not saying that TV is dying or anything, it is simply lacking the quality it once had when most of us high school students now were just kids.
</p>
                <p>While I was channel surfing one day, I came across this interesting show on Jack TV. The series was entitled “The Big Bang Theory”. What mostly caught my eye about this show was its unique subject matter. “The Big Bang Theory” is a sitcom just like the popular “How I Met Your Mother” series, but it focuses on an entirely different stereotype of people, the nerd. From all the comedy one sees on TV, these shows never thought of portraying the lives of intellectuals. I can’t remember any other sitcom that focuses on such a looked-down upon stereotype and successfully makes one laugh his heart out.</p>
                <div id="entry_pic"><img src="002.jpg" border = "none" width="570"/></div>
        
                <p>The Big Bang Theory revolves around the lives of friends Sheldon, Leonard, Howard, Raj and Penny. These friends, excluding Penny, are near geniuses at what they do. The men of the group are all scientists with degrees, honors, etc. and the show does a good job of portraying this. Though it may be interesting that they are incredibly smart, the hook of the show is their daily, normal life antics. These friends go to conventions, play video games, normally visit the comic book store and the like. A lot of the comedy comes from how these characters respond to the real life situations and hilarity ensues most of the time. The way these characters live out their lives is just so funny and interesting that it’s hard to not care about what might happen to them next. They go through things like have card battles with celebrities, go to the North Pole, steal the extended cut an Indiana Jones movie and so much more.

                <p>I recommend for anyone to watch “The Big Bang Theory”. I see endless potential for this show because again, it just portrays the everyday lives of these nerdy and immensely entertaining characters. If you’re anything like me, you’ll come to love this show after just a few episodes and will always stick around for more of the lives of Dr. Sheldon Cooper and co.</p>
