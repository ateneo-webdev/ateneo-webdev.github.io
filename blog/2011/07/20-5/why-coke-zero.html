                <p><strong>(Webdev)</strong> -- Why drink Coke Zero? You people might be wondering how Coke Zero exemplifies Coca-Cola pleasure with zero sugar. We drink Coke Zero because we believe that it will reduce our risks of getting diabetes or fats. We wonder - how the hell did the sweet taste appear in Coke Zero? Or rather, is it really not unhealthy?</p>
                <p>There is this chemical visible in Coke Zero and other zero sugar products which provides delight to the tongue called aspartame. As a substitute for sugar, it promotes dieting and weight-loss. In addition, aspartame is also present as sweeteners for Nestea, Pepsi Max, low-calorie foods, and in the majority of soda products even before Coke Zero arrived in the marketing industry.  But before we know it, drinking Coke Zero has dangerous side effects due to aspartame, which makes its identity more harmful than sugar. According to <i>righthealth.com</i>, aspartame produces physical symptoms such as sudden memory loss, dizziness, and gradual loss of vision, which may lead to more extreme disorders like multiple sclerosis, chronic fatigue, rheumatoid arthritis, depression, mood swings, and most when taken exaggeratedly, malevolent brain tumors.</p>
        
                <p>Aspartame damages the brain through extravagantly stimulating neurons, thus interfering normal brain functions. Scientists recommend to reduce intake of Coke Zero and other “zero sugar” products with aspartame. Before we know it, drinking Coke Zero is harmful to our health. It takes one hour of our delicate lives one-by-one in every can we consume. One of my friends once said, “Izezero mo lang buhay mo sa zero sugar.” In reality, I have only drunk Coke Zero thrice in my whole life. How about you, why bother drink Coke Zero?</p>
